## Lyrics

```
tell me what that about 
i really wanna know 

now we really get to talk 
what makes you (all) mad 

quit throwin' (these) sighs, 
feeling downed is
what stops you cold 

what makes you draw
blank faces wrong
doing nothing worth
while coaching all
not to drop and fall

kneeling down to other's

thoughts like damn 
that (what) makes us low (go)

little bit of facts
all it took was bites



riding (in) vicious tracks, feeling inside out
just get it out 
i'll do what's needs done
i'm an honest man
maybe just to honest
to make you feel at home

so shout to me and make it count
get it out i'll do what gets you done
i'm an honest man, maybe just too honest
to make you feel at home



making choices run, 


```
